# Tests/Traversal — Sync: Current State

```
LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-30
UPDATED_BY: Claude (agent)
MODULE: tests/traversal
STATUS: stub
```

---

## Current State

Test module for SubEntity traversal functionality. Currently contains only placeholder files (__init__.py, test_embedding.py).

**Test coverage:** 0% (no tests implemented yet)

---

## Active Work

None. Test module is a stub awaiting implementation.

---

## Recent Changes

### 2025-12-30: Created Documentation

- Created PATTERNS and SYNC docs for test module
- Documented intended test scope (SubEntity traversal, embedding similarity)

---

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| No tests implemented | High | test_embedding.py is empty |
| No test fixtures | High | Need synthetic graph data for testing |

---

## TODO

- [ ] Implement embedding similarity tests
- [ ] Create test fixtures for small synthetic graphs
- [ ] Add multi-hop traversal test cases
- [ ] Test context expansion strategies

---

## Handoff

**For agents:** This is a test module stub. If implementing traversal tests, follow pytest conventions and use fixtures for graph setup.

**Test data location:** Create fixtures in conftest.py

**Coverage target:** 80% for traversal algorithms
