# Tests/Traversal — Behaviors

## Observable Test Behaviors

**When tests run:**
- Pytest discovers and executes test_*.py files
- Fixtures provide synthetic graph data
- Assertions verify expected traversal results

**Test output:**
- Pass/fail status for each test case
- Coverage report showing traversal code coverage
