# MIND MCP CLIENT - GRAPH BOOTSTRAP
# =============================================================================
#
# Minimal seed for MCP client projects.
# File ingestion creates Spaces and Things from repo structure.
# This seed adds Actors (agents) that can work on the codebase.
#
# Run order:
#   1. File ingestion (creates space:root and directory spaces)
#   2. Seed injection (creates actors, links to existing spaces)

# SUMMARY
# =============================================================================
#
# From seed-injection.yaml:
#   Nodes: 5 agents (assistant, scout, fixer, builder, reviewer)
#   Links: 5 inhabits (all agents in root space)
#
# From git config (dynamic):
#   - Human actor with name/email from git config user.name/user.email
#   - Repo Thing with URL from git remote.origin.url
#   - GitHub API info if public: description, topics, license, stars, etc.
#
# From file ingestion:
#   - Spaces from directories
#   - Things from files
#   - Contains links (Space → Thing)
