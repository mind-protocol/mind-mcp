## PURPOSE

Periodically assess project state and determine how to move forward. Update docs, create tasks, resolve blockers.

**Organ metaphor:** Executive function — strategic planning, prioritization, unblocking.

---

## RANKED OBJECTIVES

### O1: Forward Motion (Priority: Critical)

Project should always have clear next steps. No stagnation.

**Measure:** Active tasks exist with clear priorities. No project-wide blockers unaddressed.

### O2: State Accuracy (Priority: Critical)

SYNC files reflect reality. Docs match code.

**Measure:** SYNC files updated within 48h of changes. No stale information.

### O3: Strategic Alignment (Priority: High)

Current work aligns with vision. No drift into irrelevant tangents.

**Measure:** Active tasks link to vision objectives.

### O4: Blocker Resolution (Priority: High)

Blockers identified and addressed. Escalations processed.

**Measure:** No escalation markers older than 7 days.

## NON-OBJECTIVES

- **NOT micromanagement** — Strategic steering, not task-level supervision
- **NOT execution** — Creates tasks, doesn't do the work
- **NOT vision setting** — Works within existing vision

---

## TRADEOFFS

- When **speed** conflicts with **thoroughness**, choose thoroughness for assessment, speed for updates.
- When **many tasks** conflicts with **few clear tasks**, choose fewer.
- We accept **longer review cycles** to ensure **accurate assessments**.

---

## SUCCESS SIGNALS

- SYNC files always current
- Clear next steps always visible
- Blockers surface and resolve within a week
- Project never feels "stuck"
